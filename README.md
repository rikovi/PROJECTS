Ethnicity Detection
•	Developed a machine learning model to classify facial images into ethnicities: Black, White, Indian, Asian, Others.
•	Utilized the UTKFace dataset for training and validation.
•	Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class ethnicity classification, achieving an accuracy of 85
•	Implemented dataset splitting algorithms for training, validation, and testing to ensure model generalizability. Built the pipeline using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV for real-time face detection.
